# Health Data Analysis (HDS) by [Center for Bioinformatics Learning Advancement and Systematic Training](https://www.cblastdu.xyz/)

## Course Description
This comprehensive 12-week course was designed to equip participants with essential skills to analyze health data using Python. Health data analysis is a critical aspect of modern healthcare, enabling evidence- based decision making and insights for improving patient outcomes and public health initiatives.

Throughout the course, students will learn how to work with real-world health datasets, implement data analysis techniques, and visualize results using powerful Python data science libraries. The course is designed for both beginners in Python and individuals with prior programming experience in other languages. 

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, participants will be able to:
1. Understanding the importance of health data analysis and its role in healthcare decision making
2. Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib) were used to import, manipulate, and visualize
health-related datasets.
3. Exploratory data analysis techniques were applied to gain insights and identify patterns in health
data.
4. Preprocess health data, handle missing values, and ensure data quality for machine learning
applications.
5. Implementation of basic machine-learning algorithms for predictive modeling.
6. Evaluate machine learning model performance using evaluation metrics
7. Perform model optimization and hyperparameter tuning to improve the machine learning model
performance.
8. Explore ethical considerations and challenges related to machine learning in the healthcare
domain.

## Prerequisites
There are no specific prerequisites for this course. However, basic familiarity with programming concepts and Python syntax is beneficial. Participants with no prior Python experience were encouraged to review the fundamentals of Python programming prior to starting the course. 

## About cBLAST 
The Center for Bioinformatics Learning Advancement and Systematics Training(cBLAST) under the authority of the University of Dhaka was established in October, 2014. The Center was established in view of the importance of 'Bioinformatics' for solving biological problems encountered during pursuit of most of the Life Sciences subjects. The applicability of Bioinformatics for managing biological data was appreciated and the Center was created as a platform for understanding and learning it. Dr. Zeba I. Seraj was  appointed as the Director  of the Center to serve a term of 3 years from January 1, 2015 and further re-appointed as the Director of the Center from January 1, 2018 for last 3 years. The center is managed by an Administrative Council of 13 members, chaired by the Honorable Vice Chancellor of the University of Dhaka. Positional members are the Dean of Biological Sciences and the Chair of the BMB Department. In addition, there are 5 more members from BMBDU, one from GEBDU, one from ISRT, DU, one from IIT, DU and one from industry.
